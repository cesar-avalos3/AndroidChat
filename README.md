Collaborators: Alec Knutsen, Yarden Tamir, Cesar Avalos, and John Russell

Implementation of an Android Chat Program

Notes:

The Java Files we edited are in AndroidChat/app/src/main/java/team/six/androidchat
  1. We have eight Android activity classes
  2. We have four Android fragment classes
  3. We have ten Asynchronous task classes for HTTP requests
  4. We have three helper classes
  
  
The layout files associated with the eight activites and four fragments are located in AndroidChat/app/src/main/res/layout

We also edited AndroidManifest.xml and added images

PHP Files for SQL Interaction are stored in a seperate Github Repo https://github.com/cesar-avalos3/AndroidChatServers

All other files were generated by AndroidStudio, and we do not take credit for this code.
